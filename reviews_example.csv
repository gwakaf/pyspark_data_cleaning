958,5977,2009-07-23,15695,Edmund C,"Our experience was, without a doubt, a five star experience. Holly and her husband, David, were the consummate hosts; friendly and accomodating while still honoring our privacy. The apartment was a charming layout with a full view and access to the home's garden The location is perfect for full engagement with the city; close to mass transit with walking proximity to the Haight, the Mission, the Castro and Golden Gate Park. I can't wait for our next visit.<br/><br/>Ted and Karen Wingerd",
958,6660,2009-08-03,26145,Simon,"Returning to San Francisco is a rejuvenating thrill but this time it was enhanced by our stay at Holly and David's beautifully renovated and perfectly located apartment. You do not need a car to enjoy the City as everything is within walking distance - great restaurants, bars and local stores. With such amenable hosts and a place to stay that enhances one's holiday, we will be returning again and again.",
958,11519,2009-09-27,25839,Denis,"We were very pleased with the accommodations and the friendly neighborhood. Being able to make a second bed out of the futon couch was particularly helpful. Having a full kitchen, a lovely walkout garden, and TV + DVD + FM stereo were added bonuses. Holly and David were most gracious and met our every request. Being within walking distance of both the Haight Street and Castro Street scenes was great. The only negative for us was the difficulty in finding on-street parking, due to both the density of the neighborhood and the construction work going on. A few evenings we had to park about 4 blocks away. For people who need to use private vehicles, this problem does restrict their plans somewhat. For people who can use public transportation and/or walk, this is no problem.",
958,16282,2009-11-05,33750,Anna,"We highly recommend this accomodation and agree with the previous postings: Holly and David were extremely helpful and friendly (but not at all instrusive), the unit itself is just superb and in a wondeful location. Unlike some other Airbnb accomodation optins, this is a dedicated rental unit, furnished with consumables (dishwashing liquid etc) and you don't have to contend with someone else's belongings or mess. A perfect and very relaxing end to our holiday, would love to stay there again one day.",
958,26008,2010-02-13,15416,V Jillian,"Holly's place was great. It was exactly what I needed.  Perfect location, super clean, and even a little patio out back. Since I go back to San Francisco frequently, there's a good chance I will make this a place I come again and again!",
958,29240,2010-03-13,78623,Mathieu,"On top of all that has been said previously, I would add that it is a very quiet place. Holly and David are very nice and accomodating. Staying with our 19-month old boy was not a problem, only a few items had to be moved out of reach - enquire if you have special needs for young kids. The backyard is lovely. There is a lively child playground in Duboce park just a minute away and you can visit the small Randall museum on rainy days. All nearby restaurants we tried welcomed children - very good & trendy restaurants are just minutes away.  It is also possible to walk to the warfs through Nob Hill, Chinatown and Downtown, even with a stroller.<br/><br/>As for parking, you can stay for 2 hours in the surrounding streets during the week (but apparently 1/2 day is safe), and unlimited time during the weekends. Although we didn't need it, there is a public parking corner Noe and Market that you may try. Take the public transport (e.g. streetcar F on Market St) and you will easily reach the touristy areas. The neighbourghood is very safe, vibrant and has awesome architecture. We loved it!<br/><br/>We can't think of a better place to stay in San Francisco.",
958,32988,2010-04-03,96027,Lauren,"This apartment was everything I could have hoped for and more. The place is extremely well appointed, comfortable and situated in one of the best places to be in San Francisco. Holly and David are wonderful hosts and make you feel right at home. I highly recommend this place!",
958,220443,2011-04-08,426888,Michelle,"Great place to stay.  I would highly recommend it!  Superb location -- half a block to Muni, and 10 minute ride to downtown.  Holly is so nice and very helpful too.<br/>Two things you may want to know:<br/>A landline is supplied for free domestic (US) calls in case your cell phone does not get a signal here (notorious for AT&T users in Duboce Park).<br/>You will hear footsteps from the little one on the floor above when he wakes up around 8 am!",
958,567690,2011-09-26,539189,Sarah,"Great location in San Francisco, really felt like a ""local"" rather than a ""tourist"" with super restaurants and transport links within a short walking distance. Apartment was wonderful and the folder containing information about the apartment/area was a thoughtful touch by Holly. Would definitely recommend staying here. ",
958,1786860,2012-07-24,2059845,Jörg,"We had a wonderful time at Holly & Davids place! It was perfect for our family of 4 (2 kids, 14 yrs & 20 months) after a long road trip through California. It was a home away from home!!!<br/><br/>We spend a week in this lovely apartment. Not only is the space perfectly equipped with everything you need for even a longer stay, it is also extremely conveniently located for families - very central with excellent connection to local transportation, close to a playground (for the little one) and a basketball court (where I've been battling every day with the older one - and at some times with the locals), and very quiet due to the cul-de-sac. And The Haight is a great area to relax (as is the garden behind the apartment). <br/><br/>To make it short: we felt very much at home, and it was almost like living there for real. We'll aways try and come back whenever we return to San Francisco!<br/><br/>Thanks to our hosts for creating this lovely & comfortable space for our family to relax!!!<br/><br/>Jörg, Yvonne, Melvin & Maxim",
958,2214082,2012-09-06,2869693,Carolyn Rose,"Holly's unit is comfortable and convenient if you wish to stay in the Haight neighborhood.  We had privacy, yet Holly was right there if we needed anything.  My husband and I felt more like personal house guests than renters.  We will definitely be back!",
958,2263537,2012-09-11,2953444,Adrienne,"Holly's place was great.  I would definitely stay there again.  The neighborhood was nice and I definitely felt safe walking around there any time of day.  Plus getting from neighborhood to neighborhood was easy whether we walked or hopped on to public transportation.  Sometimes the upstairs footsteps were easy to hear and came early in the morning but it never kept me up.  I would definitely stay there again. <br/>",
958,3553733,2013-02-16,134792,Robert,"This is a great place in a wonderful neighbor centrally located in Lower Haight. This is a dedicated vacation rental so everything you need is included in the space.<br/>Wonderfully decorated apartment, well lit with a nice little garden in back.<br/>",
958,4392049,2013-05-02,1635153,Lisa,Our stay at Holly's apartment was absolutely wonderful. The neighborhood is beautiful and the apartment is very close to transportation. The apartment was thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed and more. Would definitely stay here again. ,
958,5040421,2013-06-09,6413536,Andrew,"Great location near Haight Street and close to Muni to get into downtown.  Friendly hosts who helped with sunscreen, lost luggage and parcel delivery.  Very relaxing, opens onto back garden and plenty of room.  Would definitely stay again.",
958,5171535,2013-06-16,5975179,Boaz,"Truly amazing place - great location near Haight Street, close to Muni station, 100 feet from a lovely park. The house itself is very clean, lovely decorated, with fully equipped kitchen and beautiful garden. Holly is super responsive and welcoming. Would definitely stay here again.",
958,5267286,2013-06-21,4549217,Cathy,"We really enjoyed staying in this cute, and airy garden apartment. It was a little cramped for me and my 2 teen boys, but we had everything we needed. The kitchen was very complete and clean which was great because we cooked a lot. Parking was easy to find and free, though we had to move the car very 2 hours (which was only difficult in the evening). Great location. The neighborhood is beautiful, and we loved being right next to the little park. We'd definitely like to return!",
958,5905160,2013-07-22,5685916,Isabelle,"This was the perfect little rental suite. It was equipped with everything you need including cookware. The place was clean and very cute. A nice addition was the use of the yard, great to eat lunch in the sun. We thought the location was perfect, you felt like you were a local. Near great restaurant and shop. The only thing is expect to hear some children footsteps in the morning at around 8 am. The noise however was never present at night. I would stay there again!",
958,5996571,2013-07-25,7347557,Cathy,Great position for exploring San Francisco- close to the Muni. The apartment was warm and comfortable with access to a washing machine and a small garden.  WiFi was patchy. There are a variety of good restaurants in the neighbourhood. We would certainly recommend this accommodation.,
958,7364408,2013-09-17,4499842,Victoria,"We had the greatest stay at Holly & David's garden unit! We couldn't have asked for a better base for our week in San Francisco. Our 3-year-old son loved playing with Holly & David's boys, and they were happy to share their scooters and balls, so appreciated! <br/>The location is perfect, right next to Duboce Park, you are so close to the playground and the N Judah Muni which takes you to downtown. The neighbourhood is lovely, with plenty of places to eat. Our favourites were the Thai, Duboce Park Cafe and Greenburgers on Haight Street. <br/>It's also walking distance to both CVS Pharmacy and Safeway, as well as smaller organic markets. <br/>The unit has everything you need, and I mean literally everything. Not only does it have a comfy bed and foldout couch, with a full kitchen - there is ample linen, umbrellas, yoga mats, sellotape - all the extras that you just might need. <br/>We found the unit to be just as represented in the pictures, with a very homely feel.<br/>We loved it and we're sure you will too. Thank you Holly & David!",
958,7817720,2013-10-04,8876124,Echo,What a gem! Holly (and her adorable son!) greeted us at the door with such warmth.  She was quick to answer any questions and never made me feel that I was inconveniencing her no matter how small the request.  My parents stayed at the apartment for a few nights and they reported the layout was very comfortable and the bed was cozy.  The backyard is so nice to have access to with a lovely citrus tree and even a charcoal grill where we made skewers and enjoyed the San Francisco Summer.  I am sure we will be renting from Holly again soon!,
958,9049799,2013-12-03,7519331,Alfiani,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The house is located in a quiet residential area, a few doors away from a beautiful park, and the MUNI which brings you directly to the main shopping district in about 10 minutes. Safeway, which is about 10 minutes' walk away, is a great place for groceries, and there is no lack of restaurants and cafes along the way. <br/>Holly has thought of everything a traveller would want, from an umbrella and guidebooks for SF, to a water purifier and a coffee maker in the kitchen. She responded to our queries promptly, and left little things that made us feel welcome, like chocolates and wine on the table when we arrived, and a bottle of moisturizer on the doorstep when the weather turned really cold. <br/>Sound travels in the house, and with Holly's two adorable young children, we could hear their footsteps through the ceiling as they went about their day. For us, it was a welcome reminder that we were living with a family, but if you are sensitive to noise, it might be something to consider when booking. <br/>We left SF with wonderful memories of staying at Holly's place, and we hope that it will bring the same to others too.",
958,12766593,2014-05-10,6745838,Toshi,"Holly's garden unit  is very nice. It is clean, comfortable and the garden is really lovely. The location is convenient too. Next to a great park, and walking distance to cafe's and some restaurants. We enjoyed our stay. ",
958,12984959,2014-05-16,1197498,Ed,"Holly's lovely apartment is exactly as advertised. <br/>First, its in a great neighborhood, one of my favorites in SF, and on a very nice street ending in a lovely park.  Second, public transportation is quite good and accessible, so you won't need a car. If you do bring a car be aware that the neighborhood, like many in SF, has some tight parking restrictions.  Third, the apartment. Well, there are those Airbnb moments when you open the front door and wonder....OMG, what a mistake.  You will have the opposite experience at Holly's place! I took one look at the furnishings, the layout and the verdant garden and went ""Ahhhh"".  Nicely furnished, tasteful yet relaxed and thoughtfully provided with everything that you might need. Comfy bed, nice bathroom and workable kitchen. Finally, Holly is a really gracious and accessible hostess. You will be happy to meet her. <br/>I will be trying to stay here again and again when I return to San Francisco.     ",
958,14349227,2014-06-17,3807407,Shaji,"We visited San Fran for a mix of work and leisure, from Seattle.  We had a terrific time at Holly's place.  The exterior is quintessential San Fran and Duboce Park is just steps away.  You get the 'feel' you are living in SF for a bit, which was the goal.  We had a car and found street parking on the weekend easily but we also used the MUNI (public transit) with stops 2 blocks away and an easy ride most anywhere.  Holly and her family were friendly, generous and helpful.  The unit is clean, updated and well laid out.  We are a family of two adults and two toddlers.  The unit is more a junior 1 bedroom but it worked well for us even without a door to the bedroom itself.  Even with the park right outside, we managed to have take-out lunch in the courtyard which is awesome and well landscaped.  The kitchen is well equipped which is helpful when you want some coffee or put together something to eat.  We also checked out Bean There, Cafe du Soleil which are nearby coffee spots.  We would easily recommend this to any family, couple or single person and we would gladly stay again.  Although you are on the bottom floor of the home, it is completely private, including the courtyard.  On another note we highly recommend: SOMA Streetfood Park for awesome truck food, Ichi Sushi in Bernal Heights, Tartine...",
958,14492437,2014-06-20,636100,Thomas,Great place! Wonderful neighborhood!  Together make a super value!,
958,16609563,2014-07-30,2253567,Matt And Anna,"Note: My mother, father, and younger brother stayed at Holly's house during a recent trip to SF. Their review is below:<br/><br/>Holly's apartment is the perfect place to stay during a visit to San Francisco! It comfortably accommodates up to 3 people - we stayed there with our teenage son and always felt like we had plenty of room. The apartment is exactly as described, perhaps even roomier than it sounds in the description. The furnishings are modern and comfortable, and the apartment is clean and well-stocked. The backyard is a lovely, quiet retreat. The neighborhood is very attractive and very family-friendly. It's accessible by public transportation to just about anywhere a visitor would like to go. The Muni Metro N-line stops one block away and can take you to downtown, Golden Gate Park, AT&T Park, and many other places. Several bus lines are also within easy walking distance as are many stores and restaurants.<br/><br/>Holly and her husband, David, are wonderful hosts. We enjoyed talking with them on several occasions, and we didn't mind at all the sounds of their young children at play. If you enjoy Thai cuisine, please take their recommendation and eat at Thep Phanom just a few blocks from their house.",
958,16843898,2014-08-03,14189953,Katie,"Holly's garden apartment was fantastic, there's no other way to describe it!  <br/><br/>The bed was extremely comfortable, the entire place was spotless and we felt relaxed as soon as we walked in.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood was great; there are super bars and restaurants only a few blocks away and the public transport links were also really handy. <br/><br/>We would definitely stay at Holly's again and would absolutely recommend it to anyone else looking to stay in Lower Haight!",
958,19415506,2014-09-12,16800225,Eben,"Holly was great and always accessible. The garden unit was just awesome and in the perfect neighbourhood, access to groceries, bars and shops all within walking distance. We couldn't have been happier with our accommodation and amenities included. It was right nextdoor to a dogpark and the tram to downtown and wharf. We would happily stay here again and would highly recommend anyone else to stay here. ",
958,19869583,2014-09-20,15095345,Consuelo,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was completely positive. The apartment is spacious, spotless, full of light, tastefully decorated and thoughtfully equipped with pretty much everything you might need (including little touches like SF guides, Woolite for washing, a big tote for shopping, etc.). The bed was exceptionally comfortable.  I found Holly’s notebook with tips on local restaurants and stores very helpful, along with a decorative wall hanging with a graphic of the neighborhood pinpointing all the Muni lines. The garden with a grapefruit tree and flowers, which I had all to myself, was a treat. A big asset for me was the landline phone with unlimited domestic calling, since I didn’t bring a cell — very few Airbnb’s in SF have this feature. Really, Holly seems to have thought of everything!<br/><br/>The location is perfect — at the end of Pierce Street by beautiful Duboce Park, thus, little traffic and totally quiet at night. There was the pattering of little feet in the mornings along with occasional squeals, but I thought that was fun, a nice homey touch and I was up anyway. The neighborhood is classic S.F., easy walking distance to all points, convenient to trams and trains. As a health nut, I was glad to have several healthfood stores, including a huge new Whole Foods, just a few blocks away. All in all, I really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it!<br/>",
958,20751295,2014-10-05,19405174,Inger,"Vi bodde väldigt bra hos Holly! Vi blev väl mottagna och det var väldigt lätt att kontakta henne. Holly hjälpte oss att ordna taxi till vår avfärd, något som vi verkligen uppskattade! Det var mysigt att sitta ute i den lilla trädgården. I området fanns många trevliga restauranger. Gatan var lugn och fin.<br/>",
958,23894983,2014-12-14,21899880,Kristin,"The apartment is in a great location, walking distance to funky neighbourhoods - Haight, Castro, Hayes Valley and Mission - and public transport. The park and playground at the end of the street (meters from the apartment) is the best we found in the whole city. Brilliant for active kids. The apartment is spacious, stylish and packed with amenities. And Holly went over and above to ensure our toddler had plenty of toys and books on rainy days.<br/>If you want to experience San Fran like a local, in a lovely apartment and great neighbourhood, then look no further. ",
958,37942773,2015-07-12,20670607,Nicola,We had a wonderful time staying at Holly's apartment. The apartment is very comfortable and well appointed and located in a great part of San Francisco close to public transport as well as some cool cafes and restaurants. Holly and her family made us feel very welcomed and were very responsive and helpful. We would happily stay there again and would highly recommend the place to others.,

958,41925251,2015-08-10,30060668,Shannon,"This home was quaint and in an amazing location. A studio-style apartment on the bottom floor of a classic looking San Francisco house. The apartment is right next to a nice park where people are out walking their dogs, and we were a short Uber ride to everything in SF.<br/><br/>Upon check-in, the unit was very clean and our host had a binder ready for us with all the information we would need including Wi-Fi password.

We had our 1 year old son with us and it was a great place for us to stay with him. It was very close walking distance to Duboce Park, the Castro, and Haight St. where there were plenty of really good restaurants. The garden was private with two accesses from the apartment and was a great place for us to relax in the evening. Holly was wonderfully hospitable and welcoming during our stay. I would highly recommend!",

We only briefly had a chance to meet Holly, but the apartment was wonderfully appointed, comfortable, and very clean. This place is best for early risers as the kid's footsteps upstairs start in earnest around 7am.<br/><br/>The back patio was lovely to sip coffee on, and we scored a fallen grapefruit from the tree. We would absolutely stay here again!",

About Holly:  she was personable, welcoming, and very concerned about our happiness and comfort.  We couldn't have asked for a better host.  About the apartment:  it's clean, convenient, quiet, and it has everything that you would need.  And if there is something that you need, ask Holly.  She will take care of it.  At the end of her street is a really nice park, and because it's on a dead-end street, there is no traffic noise whatsoever, no matter what time of day.  It was really like being in the country, which, for SF, is incredibly amazing.  We highly recommend staying with her - you will have no regrets.  In fact, we asked her if she would adopt us so that we could stay forever.  No luck.  But we'll be back.  Holly, Cathy and I want to thank you and your husband very  much for our excellent visit.",

958,76485776,2016-05-27,37181118,Alberto,"Holly was a great host.  That cheesy line on tv about not visiting a place but actually living there is true!  Her place has a very home like feel and the garden in the back was perfect for my 2  year old.  Interacting with Holly is very easy and felt like dealing with a neighbor next door.  The other reviews are right in that you can hear little footsteps at certain times but it was never a problem for us because I have a little one as well and was up and around then or was visiting the city.  The listing is sooo ideal, close to the muni train and bus stops.  Next to a park and within walking distance to groceries, corner stores, and restaurants.  It felt bittersweet leaving but it was time to leave and staying at Holly's made our visit so comfortable after long days of sight seeing.  If I come back I am for sure staying here again.",

There is also a lovely play park right next to the house.  <br/><br/>We found some amazing restaurants close by: Chow, and Duboce Cafe (just around the corner).<br/><br/>Very private and never felt like we were in the basement of a home.<br/><br/>Would recommend this apartment highly.",

958,103155799,2016-09-20,16017320,Deborah,"Great location, very accessible to public transport, coffee shops, the Mission and Castro! The apartment was very comfortable and well equipped. It was lovely having a garden courtyard and we even saw hummingbirds! However, it was difficult to reach our host to confirm arrangements and how to get in to the apartment. We didn't receive a confirmation email or welcome info and compared to other Airbnb stays it was sub standard client service. It meant we were waiting on doorstep wondering if it was all going to be ok.  It was, but would have preferred not having to wonder. The apartment was under the living area of the house and with two boisterous boys we were woken up early by running and thumping above us on what seemed rice paper ceilings. Despite that we enjoyed our time in San Fransisco but would stay somewhere else next time. ",

The apartment is well equipped and quite,… except when the kids above wake up around 7:15am! We had to fight to remove a panel which kept one of the windows open at all times: we were freezing!<br/>But otherwise, the place is comfortable, the shower is great and the bed, despite not so wide, is really good.",

958,110253368,2016-10-25,1601284,Ted & Noelle,"We stayed a week in Holly's wonderful garden apartment and could not have been happier with our experience. Holly was extremely gracious and welcoming and was prompt with all communications. The apartment is spacious and sunny, with two sets of french doors opening up onto a verdant and charming back garden (with a grapefruit tree!), which we had to ourselves. The space was spotless and modern yet homey, with a very comfortable bed & bed linens, plenty of storage space for our things, and a wonderful large eat-in kitchen. The bathroom was great, with a deep bathtub and nice rain-type shower head, and the availability to do laundry was a nice bonus.  <br/><br/>The location of this apartment was ideal for our needs -- literally steps from Duboce Park and the MUNI N-line and only a couple of blocks from Church and Duboce, where you can take MUNI to basically anywhere in the city. We commuted to the end of downtown several mornings during rush hour within about 7 minutes.  BART stations are a few minutes away by MUNI and are easy to reach. Plus, there are a million things within an easy walk from the apartment:  restaurants & bars, coffee shops, groceries, farmer's market, etc. <br/><br/>We can't wait to stay at Holly's place next time we're in San Francisco!",
958,113447829,2016-11-12,7072527,Richard,Holly was quick to respond to our questions. There was a full kitchen which wasn't clear from the photos. the neighberhood is actually the best one in the area. The appartment is very quite.  ,

Very safe with many places walkable, including the panhandle leading to Golden Gate park. Lots and lots of restaurants and bars on nearby Divisidero street, but far enough away to make it very quiet.

The apartment was more baby-friendly than I expected and we only had to move a couple of vases and an alarm clock to a place where our son couldn't reach.<br/>As expected from a five-star host, everything we needed to know was spelled out in the house guide. Her recommendations on restaurants were spot on and the guide book having menus/flyers from local restaurants that deliver to home was a great help.<br/>The area is very family-friendly with Duboce park being so close and yet quite interesting with  many cafes and restaurants in the vicinity. We'd love to stay again on future trips.",

However, I would recommend this location.  The apartment was clean, easy to access, and satisfied all of our needs.  Great location!  Parking is a challenge due to construction, so I don't suggest having a rental car.  The apartment was supplied with all kitchen and bathroom essentials.  Basically, the apartment is exactly as represented in her pictures.  We would definitely stay there again if we visit San Francisco.   ",

The backyard is beautiful and Holly had lights installed while we stayed with her!  We only wish the weather had been a bit warmer so we could enjoy spending more time out back with her new pup Tucker!  <br/>Located near public transport and a very affordable Lyft ride from most places in the city, I would love to stay at Holly's again.  There was a ton of information left for us and available in the space, and Holly was so very accomodating to our early landing time and late take off.  Not having to worry about our luggage was such a relief.  She even offered to let us borrow an umbrella for the rain!<br/>Just a heads up, as Holly very clearly states, they have children and they absolutely CAN be heard in the apartment below.  It didn't bother us, we're early risers and had work to do, but if you sleep sensitively and sleep in, maybe look for another place.  But for us, the space and location were absolutely perfect and Holly was such an amazing host.  Thanks a lot Holly!",

Located in Upper Haight or or was it Lower Duboce, maybe East Turnbuckle? ...regardless, The apartment is in a great central location for exploring the City.  There is a Whole Foods and a Safeway, not far away, staring each other down across Market, like Hatfields and McCoys. The park (Duboce) at the end of the street is lovely.  We walked all over and ventured farther on the light rail - Which is a stone's throw from the apartment.  The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and well-appointed including a full kitchen. The bed was super-comfy for this cranky lower back.  There are Uber galore, typical wait times were about 10-15 min. Shout-out to an amazing tapas place we stumbled on - Aatxe on Market. <br/>The apartment is in the basement of a lovely historic home, and a busy family lives upstairs. We enjoyed our stay in complete privacy, communicating through AirBnB when needed. Holly was quick to respond with any requests. Big thank you allowing us to stow our luggage after check-out!",

We didn't get a chance to meet Holly, but we spoke with her husband, who was very nice and offered to provide recommendations for our trip.

We were stuck with a car because we were supposed to go to Sonoma, and parking can be tricky. There is a lot of construction around, so it is hard to find a spot.

We could occasionally hear the pitter patter of little feet as their adorable 6 and 8 year olds played with Tucker, the dog.  It was never a problem for us at all.  The space was comfortable with a full kitchen which we used to make oatmeal for breakfast and to reheat some food for dinner.

It’s convenient to Public transportation and shops/ bars/ restaurants/ grocery stores/ drug stores/ everything you might need. <br/>The space itself is nicely kept up and clean, with nice touches, such as bath products, ground coffee for drip and French press, and travel books/ guides. <br/>Check-in and check out was super easy and convenient. <br/>The only thing is that you can hear them a bit upstairs but they keep very, very reasonable hours so it shouldn’t be a big deal. They let the dog out a few times a day so he came to say hello (which we loved). If you’re scared of dogs or have an allergy, it probably won’t be a big deal since he doesn’t come in the unit, but he’s definitely there. :)",

958,328291177,2018-09-25,34139709,Shawn,Very nice/clean space. Great location. Difficult to find parking so would not suggest if you have a car. Would definitely recommend,
958,332582581,2018-10-05,79626329,Jon,"The location of this space is fantastic. Go left out the door and you are literally next to Duboce Park and the Muni N Judah train which takes you downtown in 15 minutes or to Sunset/Ocean Beach in half an hour. Go right and you've got Haight and a plethora of places to eat and drink. Castro is 10 mins walk away. As a returning guest to SF the space couldn't have been better located. The flat itself is spacious and modern and bright with doors out on to a patio/garden that caught the sun all day. All amenities provided - including a lovely deep bath, coffee in fridge, books, guides, tea etc. <br/>The only very slight negative I would mention is that you are underneath the family home so you do hear a lot of noise during the day. So if, like us, you like to have a power nap in the late afternoon before going back out in the evening, be prepared for footfall and what sounded like piano lessons! But this is probably not a concern for most - just us lazy bones who needed a lie-down around 4/5pm! Don't let it put you off. A fabulous place to stay and I would go back in a heartbeat.",

Holly came down to introduce herself when I checked in and was sweet enough to bring a fan down to me for white noise for sleeping :)  The neighborhood is GREAT - right in the middle of the city and you can easily walk or uber to all sorts of great restaurants, Twin Peaks, etc. The place was clean and the bed was comfy, and there was a french press and ground coffee....loved it!  Sometimes you could hear people walking around upstairs but it was never too disturbing. Overall I loved it and would absolutely stay there again.",
958,339588035,2018-10-21,122110933,Hernan,"This place is great! Very nicely decorated, loved the garden and it was perfect to relax. The area is cute and quiet, very close to Buena Vista Park and just 2 minutes away from Haight and it’s cool restaurants and bars.

958,342468218,2018-10-28,189494409,Jason,"Holly's place was perfect for our family of 3 for our week's stay in San Francisco. We much preferred this location compared to the hotels in Union Square which were extremely busy and loud (there was a hotel strike through our entire visit), and had a more local feel to it. In the local area to the Airbnb location, there were various stores, cafes and restaurants. Our favourite for breakfast being Kate's Kitchen with the extremely friendly and attentive staff who had such a great presence about them. <br/>She and her family were very friendly and approachable if we had any questions or queries. Holly herself was quick to reply to messages via the Airbnb app.<br/>As others have stated, this Airbnb is for early rises like ourselves as Holly and her family live upstairs in the main house so can be heard from around 6.30am. <br/>The apartment had everything you could think of that you'd need for your stay including an iron, towels, shampoo, washing machine and tumble dryer. <br/>we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this apartment to friends and family who are wanting to visit SF in the future.",

958,349186191,2018-11-16,28251745,Naomi,"This was a great place for me to stay traveling alone. It was SUPER convenient to public transportation and had tons of awesome amenities. As is mentioned in the description, you can definitely hear the upstairs very well and need to be an early riser (around 7am) if you don’t want your sleep interrupted. The backyard is also a great place to relax and unwind. Overall a great stay and I would recommend!",
958,353153995,2018-11-26,48443110,Eric,"Holly’s place is fantastic. The location is perfect for getting anywhere in San Francisco in 30 minutes or less by public transit (muni train or bus) as it’s located right next to a park with a muni train stop. Haight Street is 2 blocks away with tons of places to eat. The park at the end of the street was great for our little one and provides a great gated off play area, and if your kids like trains they will love the park. We searched for days looking for a good place to stay in San Francisco, and this could not have been any better.  It’s really nice coming to San Francisco and not staying in an overpriced union square hotel. You get to experience a totally different side of SF being out in Debose/Haight area. If you happen to find this listing available you won’t find a better deal for everything you get with this apartment. This place will always be my first spot to look when coming to San Francisco in the future.",

We were in SF for our daughter’s wedding and having the N Judah line within 300 yards of the front steps of the home to get to Union Square and Embarcadero in 10-15 minutes was convenient and very pleasant.

Phone service was not good unless you went to a outside door.  Photos on AirBnB site are accurate.   Price per night seems to be based on how many persons are staying in the unit.   When my son decided to stay with us and I increased number of guests from 2 to 3,  the price per night increased.  Construction going on next door .  Starts around 7:30am.  Check with host to find out status of project if you think this may effect your sleep schedule.",

Un parque enorme justo al lado con parque infantil. En el apartamento puedes encontrar todo lo necesario para la estancia, baño cómodo, cocina práctica, y estilo modernillo. La cama no es la más cómoda del mundo pero para unos días es aceptable. La casa es muy bonita y la calle tranquila pero aparcar por la zona parece imposible. También hay varias cafeterías en un radio de 5 minutos y más diversidad de restaurantes en un radio de 10 minutos, incluyendo un par de supermercados bastante grandes.",

There are a lot of good cafes and shops around the area as well.<br/>The apartment itself was clean and private. There were lots of pillow options and cooking supplies. The backyard is a lovely place to enjoy a small garden in the mornings.<br/>While we were there construction was happening next door. Holly informed us months ahead of time and offered a refund or discount. She was very communicative about it, apologetic, and willing to work with us.<br/>I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore the whole city using Muni. Once construction is done next door this spot will be perfect.",

The grocery store was a short walk away, we could walk to some great eateries and bars, and by jogging could explore several parks, including the Panhandle and Buena Vista. Buena Vista has a fabulous lookout on the city. As she talks about in her description, there was definitely the normal noise of typical family life from upstairs, but we’re used to that and it wasn’t bothersome. The construction next door was loud, but again, we knew that before we got there, and it wasn’t a big deal. All the essentials for cooking, bathing, and resting were there.

958,545670168,2019-10-12,12606101,B. Bea,"Holly's place is right next to the park on an adorable street and a short walk to some great options for bars and restaurants. The studio was clean and cute with doors out to the backyard and chairs to relax. Holly was also very responsive. One hiccup was the electric door. I like to be able to lock any place I am staying at from the inside and there didn't seem to be a way to do so because when we turn the knob from inside, we altered the locking mechanism on the electric lock and then weren't able to lock the door at all. Holly ended up having to help us. Too high tech for me. Another hiccup was that I had to locate my own sheets for the futon. The rate was great, but the cleaning fee was high. Overall though, this is a great spot and studio to explore San Francisco. If I was staying longer, I would book again.",

Having stayed here before, I knew that you could tell that there was a family up above but it’s never bothered us - we’re always early to bed and early to rise and it’s a nice reminder that you’re staying in a neighbourhood rather than a sterile downtown hotel. Work on property next door was evident from the noise, but again not an issue as we were out all day anyway. Local area is fantastic - walking distance to many great neighbourhoods, parks and landmarks - not to mention bars and restaurants. As long as this place is available we won’t stay anywhere else in SF!!",

The kitchen is well equipped with anything you would need to cook during your stay. The view to the garden outside is tranquil. Holly is a very thoughtful and communicative host. And the whole experience felt very safe, in terms of Covid cleanliness, etc. Street parking was manageable and the location ideal for touring many areas of the city. As mentioned in Holly’s description you can hear activity above, but it was limited to a few hours in the early evening.

It was in the cutest neighborhood right next to the park (which public transportation stops at!) parking was fairly easy to find because we were there on the weekend so we could leave our rental car where it is, however if you’re there during the week I’d recommend avoiding a rental and taking Uber/public transport as there are time limits to parking during the weekdays. <br/>Loved the apartment- it was clean with everything we could need!

Having the train (muni) pass right by the playground every few minutes was kind of magical for our four year old. Location felt central to different places we needed to get to, and our host was excellent about accommodating our bicycle entourage in her family's garage. Space is great - clean, well-stocked kitchen, interesting books, and - most critically - games and puzzles for kids. Outside seating area in the succulent garden excellent for evening drinks and to chat.",

The muni tram is right out the back door and can take you to the beach or downtown within half and hour. Check in and out was easy. Be advised that parking for the day is not possible near the house, so we parked a 15 minute walk away at buena vista park (72hr street parking) for most of our stay.

The apartment is well appointed and so much cozier than staying in a hotel. Having access to laundry was also critical, so I was grateful to Holly for making that available. Playing fetch with their dog Tucker in the courtyard was a definite high point (I was missing my dog). I highly recommend this location to anyone and I hope to return, myself, someday.",

Ideal for those that don’t want to stay in the touristy areas. One of the few affordable options with a kitchen, which was a huge plus for us.

However, this time I decided to opt for the much more lovely Haight/Duboce area and I'm so happy I did - this airbnb was the perfect place. The studio has a cute back yard, spacious floor plan, and is just steps from Duboce park and all the great restaurants/bars on Divisadero.

It was both cozy and spacious at the same time. It had everything we needed for our family of three to be perfectly comfortable for our three nights. My only observation is that I wish the bed were more comfortable. <br/>We loved the location as we have a little guy and no matter how much we did all day he still had extra energy for the park which was right at the end of the block. Holly even lent us a soccer ball to take with us! They had several games and crayons and things in the unit which my son also took advantage of. <br/>We were able to walk to several places including delicious restaurants, some slides we found online, the Castro District, and the Painted Ladies. The neighborhood was so charming. We drove up from LA and parking wasn’t an issue for us as we are used to parking signs and moving our car.  <br/>Lastly, we work hard to live a green, plastic- free life and I saw several efforts to do this within the unit which I really appreciated. Definitely would recommend Holly’s place to anyone looking for a great place to stay in SF.",

958,850106714442469864,2023-03-18,324606807,Linda,"Not knowing San Francisco,  it’s hard to pick a good neighborhood. Fortunately, this place is in a really nice area. Cute little place next to a great park, lot so eateries, etc. Host was very accommodating and responsive. Had lots of amenities in the Airbnb. Blanket, games, coffee….For us,  It was basically a place to lay our heads down at night. We didn’t spend any time there during the day. My only slight gripes…once you opened the entry door, you have to walk through their garage to get to another door which led you to the unit. It was hard to see cause it was dark so we had to use our phones to see cause we couldn’t find the light switch.  The other slight issue was, there is no sound barrier between you and the people above you that are in the main house. You can hear every footstep loud and clear so at night that was a little bothersome, but then it quieted down.  But over all it was a great place and I recommend it.",

Fantastic location, right by Duboce Park with transport links straight to downtown and out to Ocean Beach. Great food options nearby (Palmyra is great!), with fantastic neighbourhoods bars close by too (highly recommend Toronado). We prefer to be left to our own devices rather than interact with our hosts. However, anything we needed Holly responded very positively immediately, and was very friendly if we happened to meet as we were coming or going from the apartment. Use of washer and dryer was very much appreciated for our two week stay. Great shower and toiletries/hairdryer so it’s great to save on packing space! Overall, this is the perfect apartment for us and we’re already planning our next stay at Holly’s!",

Art was amazing and I appreciated being left alone even though the hosts were there. <br/>Note of caution- if you’re going to use the backyard mornings, you will be interacting with a large and very friendly dog. He’s well behaved and doesn’t enter the guest space, he does poop in the backyard though. I didn’t have any issues with it, because I am a fan of every dog I meet but I know people who would be bothered so mentioning it here.",

They also had a generous selection of toys and books that kept my antsy toddler occupied, including a toy train that delighted her for hours. The back garden was serene and filled with fruit trees, succulents, and hummingbirds and a periodic friendly dog from upstairs. The space does not have air conditioning, but managed to keep relatively cool and comfortable even in a heat wave. The neighborhood is walkable and very bike friendly, and a charming neighborhood park is just down the end of the block. We had a great stay.",

958,1300214194546527906,2024-11-28,81840441,Kathy,"The location of this apartment can't be beat, on a residential block that dead ends at quiet Duboce Park. Cafes, markets nearby and walkable with good public transit (or try a self-driving Waymo!). There's a lovely private garden in back with a lemon tree (it was too rainy on our stay to enjoy it) and lots of light in the apartment as a result. The shower is perfect and the kitchen is one of the best stocked AirBnBs we've seen as far as utensils and supplies. Unfortunately, there's no stove, so cooking was a bit of a challenge. We made do with microwave, toaster oven and hot plate. There's also a slow cooker. We didn't sleep on the couch/futon, but it seems best for kids. The main bed is on the soft side. As others have mentioned, you can hear activity from upstairs, but not early or late, and the same is true of other places we've stayed nearby. If you're going to be out and about, it's no big deal. We love this block for our SF home base and would definitely stay again!",

The location is in a super quiet neighborhood, on a dead-end street, yet mere blocks from transportation, Safeway, Whole Foods and many neighborhood restaurants. <br/>The ground floor apartment overlooks a very attractive garden. The kitchen is well laid out and despite the lack of a stove/oven the induction hot plate, microwave and toaster oven suffice.<br/>Holly was quickly responsive and friendly. The comprehensive binder offered local knowledge for transportation, shopping, sight-seeing and restaurants. <br/>Would we stay again? Yes!",

5858,2993,2009-05-23,11966,Annick,Great place to stay in SF. Tania and Philip were very welcoming. They gave us good advice on SF musts & don'ts.

Also, the library is every artist/designer's dream come true.<br/><br/>It's the small moments at Tania and Philip's that makes the stay so memorable – the conversations, the guidebooks on the nightstand, Tania's brown sugar oatmeal with peaches for breakfast, having a cup of tea sitting in the sunroom, your hosts leaving the guest room light on at night so that you can spot the apartment's window from the street when coming home at night, a morning run to Dolores Park, etc...<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend anyone who seeks a quiet and peaceful home away from home when visiting SF to stay here!",

They have such a beautiful house and a very nice terrace as well. Our room was very clean and our bed was very comfortable. <br/>They did not only offer us cereal for breakfast, but even let us eat with them for dinner.<br/>As we did not really know what to do in San Francisco, except the touristic stuff, Philip planed each day with us although he was ill.<br/>They both were really welcoming and we felt very comfortable at their home. In addition we met some of their friends who were also very adorable. They made our dreams of airbnb come true.

Non seulement ils m'ont laissé la cuisine à disposition pour le petit déjeuner, mais ils m'ont également invité plusieurs fois à manger avec eux et leurs amis le soir. C'était formidable.<br/><br/>Leur appartement, situé dans une maison de style victorien, est aménagé avec beaucoup de goût. Les belles plantes arrosées et cultivées avec amour par Tania s'harmonisent parfaitement avec les meubles design conçus par Philip. Quant à la véranda et au jardin intérieur, c'est un vrai plaisir visuel!<br/><br/>Ne cherchez pas de Big-Mac à la cuisine, de presse people sur la table du salon ou de télévision écran-plat sur le mur de votre chambre. Chez Philip et Tania, vous trouverez une cuisine végétarienne et équilibrée, des livres de référence et des journaux de qualité, ainsi que des discussions intéressantes et fort enrichissantes.<br/><br/>Partager la gentillesse, l'humour et la générosité de Philip et Tania durant mon séjour à San Francisco fut un vrai privilège!

5858,144261,2010-11-25,226314,May,"A first and interesting airbnb experience. Tania and Philip's Creative Sanctuary is a beautifully decorated home located close to some very interesting neighbourhoods and local favourite restaurants/cafes (Philip has his List!). They have many good suggestions for what to do, where to go etc., and there is quite a lot in SF to distract you on a beautiful November day. Thanks for the use of the space, the fun kitchen (and Tania showing me how to make perfect boiled eggs with firm whites and bright orangey soft yolks in her enviable Le Crueset pan!), and for the much needed space heater to combat the fickle SF November weather! I loved sitting in the extended dining area watching the swiftly changing clouds go by through the glass window-walls. Cheers. ",

Philip and Tania allowed full use of the house....They were very helpful and informative....It was approximately an hours walk into the city which I did for exercise but there are trams and busses and the BART only a couple of blocks away....It seems like there is a restaurant or cafe on every corner and they were all sensational....The Front Porch was great for dinner as was Martha's Coffee for breakfast or lunch.  There was also a coffee shop right on the corner a couple of buildings away which had OK food if you dont want to walk a block or two....great location really...I would recommend this property to other prospective travellers.",
5858,174320,2011-01-24,159737,Johan,"This is a wonderful place to stay at if you are in the SF area.  Philip and Tania are both very hospitable and friendly.  Additionally, the room is right at the house entrance, so you can come and go early in the morning, late at night, etc.",

This was a quick last minute birthday get-away celebration for her 18th birthday so I was grateful for a place that felt safe, secure and comfortable.  I found their communication with our last-minute arrangements top-notch.  We experienced a warm welcome. The bed was comfortable, the setting peaceful and quiet. I let our daughter select the location and she was immediately drawn to the artistic design.  They have a beautiful place that we definitely recommend to other San Francisco travelers looking for great hospitality at an affordable price!",

The house is wonderful, cozy and inviting with parade of happy plants, lovely fixtures, and beautifully curated art all around the house.   The bed was super comfortable and I slept really well as there is hardly any street noise, and getting to down town was a breeze on a J-train just a quick walk from the house.

I came straight from the airport and what I needed was somewhere quiet and comfortable where I could relax and not have to be too sociable.  Having traveled from London, I was worn out and slept almost immediately.<br/><br/>When I woke I came out and met Philip - who knew that the first person I really spoke to when I arrived in the USA would be an expat Englishman?!?<br/><br/>I wish that I could have spent  more time chatting with Tania and Philip, they  were extremely friendly, helpful and kind and made me feel completely at home.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend their home to anyone looking for a calming, relaxed experience in a lovely Victorian house with good people..",

There was a slight misunderstand regarding our date and time of arrival but they quickly made arrangements and still welcomed us into their home.  <br/><br/>I find the other reviews spot on. The only disadvantage we found was that there was only one bathroom located by the kitchen area. We essentially shared it with them and had no issues. <br/><br/>The bedroom was bright, spacious and always equipped with clean towels. We had Wi-ifi connection at all times and were even given a quick guide/map with many close by restaurants, markets and specialty stores.<br/><br/>We definitely recommend it! ",

Despite them being away on holiday, they were very attentive...corresponding with us on a regular basis before, during, and following our trip.  They and their friend/house-sitter Maya were extremely accommodating and flexible with both check-in and check-out.  They have a very beautiful Victorian home with the charm and history of what one expects San Francisco living to be like.  Furthermore, they live on a quiet street in a great neighborhood full of cafes, boutiques, and friendly people.  Just three blocks from the J Church Muni line and approximately 3/4 of a mile from the 24th Street Mission BART station, their prime location made it easy (and inexpensive) to travel around the city, to/from the airport, and to cities and towns throughout the Bay Area.

Parking was always available within 1-3 blocks.  It's very close to Dolores Park, and all of the best restaurants in the city, yet still a removed enough so that it's quiet and peaceful on the street at night.  The solarium, deck, and backyard are the best, and Philip and Tania were incredibly friendly and accomodating.  All and all a perfect stay!",

She was so prompt responding to my emails and answering all the questions I had about the house, location, transportation, etc.   The pictures do not do the place justice.  Upon my arrival, the place far exceeded my expectations.  The pictures do not do it justice.  Tania greeted us when we arrived and showed us around the place and how things work.  My kids and I truly enjoyed a special haven in San Francisco.  The neighborhood is great.  San Fran's best ice cream place is around the corner as well as a Safeway super market.  The J train is a short 3 block walk over to Church Street.  The neighborhood is a very safe quiet residential neighborhood but lots of restaurants and shops to walk to nearby along Valencia and 24th Street.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",
5858,46193229,2015-09-08,30620043,Luc,"Our stay at Tania and Philip's place was absolutely wonderful. Our favourite airbnb to date! Their house is obviously lived in; it's incredibly warm and well equipped. Very tastefully decorated and a delightfully relaxing place to be in. The kitchen is one of the best equipped we've ever been in and the plethora of cookbooks was well appreciated. Close walking distance to Mission and Valencia Streets, about 20 mins from the hub of cafes and restaurants. Tania and Philip were so hospitable and easy to communicate with, I would definitely recommend this airbnb.",

An excellent base to see the city.<br/>Philip and Tania left thorough instructions and checked in with us  to see we were ok and all we needed. Excellent attentive hosts. <br/>We knew the neighbourhood already",

8142,19570089,2014-09-14,21066743,Josh,"This was perfect for what I needed: a cheap place to stay while I was moving to a new place in the city. Aaron was very kind, understanding, and obviously cares about this place. I was worried at first that such a cheap place would be dirty, but I cannot explain how nice it was that Aaron works so hard to have a place be cheap but also be very, very clean (most of friend's apartments aren't this clean!). It was the bare necessities done right! Overall a great, extremely easy, no hassle experience that really helped me out.",
8142,27387405,2015-03-03,19057602,Pame,"Aaron make us feel at home. He is the best!<br/>Thank you very much. I'd definitely return to the same place.",

This place is in a great part of the city called Cole Valley. It has a to. Of stores, restaurants and bars near by. It was even walking distance to my job at UCSF hospital.  After my stay here I will now move to Cole Valley.  Thank you Aaron!<br/>",

The place was great and clean and has a spectacular location being right in front of the muni station. Also, neighborhood is very nice and right next to GG park which has been amazing for early morning walks. Can't recommend this place enough!",

He was responsive to my needs (i.e., printing, laundry services, Wi-Fi issues, clean sheets, personally delivered packages to my door) and prioritized safety and security for his tenants. Great location for anyone working at UCSF Parnassus hospital - can’t find a better deal in terms of cost and proximity.",
8339,11391,2009-09-25,39816,Kirsten,"My stay was wonderful in many ways; the apartment is very clean, comfortable & artful. Bus & muni train were a short, easy walk. All amenities (market, laundry) nearby. I was glad not to have a car. Rosy & family were welcoming & quick to offer help when asked, but otherwise I didn't see them. Guests have their own fridge, & space to store food, as well as shared staples & condiments. Kids are welcome & I wouldn't hesitate to return again, with my family. It was delightful to visit in Italian, & several languages are fluently spoken. I highly recommend this lovely place. ",
8339,13705,2009-10-15,37632,Sarah-Jane,"As a family staying with Rosy's family we found the apartment to be spacious, comfortable, well equipped and incredibly elegant. A wonderful space to return to after a busy day - better than a real home from home. The welcome from our hosts was very warm. Upon arrival after a long journey they had prepared a meal for our travel weary children. They were knowledgeable about places to visit and the local public transport which we found to be very useful. The location of the apartment, Lower Haight, is vibrant yet quiet and safe at night with easy access to grocery stores, deli’s, laundry and some good bars and restaurants. The buses stop close by and run very frequently to most areas. We found no need for a car during our stay. Staying with Rosy and her family in San Francisco was a unique and wonderful experience and one that we would love to repeat at some future point - an authentic San Francisco experience, in a beautiful neighbourhood with wonderful hosts and much MUCH better than staying in a hotel. If you want to experience the REAL San Francisco then stay with Rosy !<br/>",
8339,33916,2010-04-06,94972,Marite,"If you are on the quest to collect unique and inspiration experiences for your mental scrapbook, this is the place! Rosy has great flair for enhancing an old victorian home with lovely antiques and superb taste in food - just go where she tells you! - Little Star Pizza, La Boulange, Tartine, Falletti. Lots of space, one queen bed in the front room with beautiful light in the day and a charming seating area.  My daughters shared a bedroom with two twin beds.  Only one little caveat, be careful in the kitchen and in the shower - sometimes gorgeous furnishings are delicate!  Enjoy!",
8339,35556,2010-04-14,93381,Opher,"Rosy and her family are great. They had everything ready for us the day we arrived including a beautiful crib (self imported from Italy) and stuffed animals waiting for our 2 year old. They were gone most of the time but when they were there we couldn't tell. Rosy's recommendations are great and the neighborhood is fantastic - right in the middle of everything. We loved the apartment, almost wished we got to spend more time with this family and would definitely do it again.",
8339,48828,2010-06-01,107821,Eric,"Rosy and her family have a fantastic home.  This was a wonderful place for us to stay during our trip to San Francisco.<br/><br/>Instead of driving a car, we stuck with the Muni and other local transportation, all of which was easy walking distance to Rosy's.<br/><br/>You absolutely must ask Rosy & her husband for advice on nearby places to eat, they recommended several spots that were marvelous.  (In fact, they told us about so many that we didn't have time to try them all!)<br/><br/>The kitchen is as beautiful as the photos make it out to be, and the rest of the area we were in had lovely details and far more interesting things then you'd ever find in a boring old hotel room!<br/><br/>Nearby is one of San Francisco's many many parks, and it's great to be able to wake up early in the morning and watch the sun (or fog) rise over the city.",
8339,70080,2010-07-28,138460,Corina,"We have had very nice days in this wonderful large victorian apartment.<br/>The extraordinary composition of white decoration and the feeling for arranging the furniture gave us relaxation and we feel like being in another century (without missing the comfort of the present century) and have a isle in the city. <br/>Rosy and her husband are very nice hosts, they gave us recommendations answered our European questions :-) and we want to recommend them as hosts and recommend this lovely place.   ",
8339,99627,2010-09-18,194503,Jon,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Rosy's, they are all lovely people and have a beautiful house in a great location. We were made to feel incredibly welcome, without any obligation or intrusion. With amazing generosity Rosy never made us feel our three children were a problem in their beautiful white china filled home. They were also able to suggest a load of useful places to visit and eat for us and the children. We absolutely recommend them.",
8339,108479,2010-09-30,128349,Bill,"Rosy and her husband were perfect hosts. Apartment was beautiful and we were made to feel extremely welcome. Kids were made to feel welcome.<br/>Apartment was in the cool part of town with heaps of restaurants etc close by. A 40 min walk to town or public transport if needed.<br/>Rosy provided heaps of tips for local haunts which was great.<br/>Only criticism would be that the master beadroon is suffers from the noisy street and the street light out the front shines in at night - perhaps some heavy curtains would be good.<br/>Would defineitely stay there again<br/>The Heath family, Melbourne Australia",
8339,131793,2010-11-01,274111,Marco,"The description of the accomodations is spot on!<br/>It is easy to see why this Queen Anne Victorian has been featured in home and interior design/architecture magazines: the scale, the palette, the furniture, the orignial Victorian details, the design kitchen... The space is soooo beautiful! Anyone who appreciates design and esthetic will find satisfaction here.<br/> <br/>Buses and muni train are just a few blockes away and taxis are easy to call on the bigger street one or two blocks off from the location. The house is literally in the center of the city proper, next to the famous Alamo Square Park with gorgeous photo op panorama of the city. The location was absolutely perfect for us with a multitude of restaurants in the vicinity, shopping, cafes and the many points of interest nearby. The hosts were super friendly, easy to talk to, with pointed tips every time. <br/> <br/>Special mention: We loved the convenience of the nearby Falleti's gourmet (really) deli that provided us with delicious full meals and allowed us more time to enjoy the city. <br/> <br/>We very much recommend Rosy's place to anybody who wants to enjoy the city culture while staying at a stunning apartment. This was not our first visit to SF, yet turned out to be our best and most memorable visit. Staying there was great, and when we come back to SF again, we will definitely try to stay at Rosy's again!<br/>Chloe and Marco  <br/> <br/><br/>",
8339,140164,2010-11-16,248181,Elliot,"Rosy was a wonderful host - everything was as advertised. She was incredibly welcoming to my family and we had an amazing time in San Francisco.<br/>Rosy and her family were gone for most of our stay, but she provided us with a lot of great tips for things to see and do in the area, and was available to answer any questions that came up.<br/>Our only difficulty was controlling the heat in the apartment, as it is an old victorian with big beautiful windows that can be a bit drafty. After a bit of wrangling, we were able to sort out the thermostat and get the heating to our comfort. Also note that the front room is very bright early in the morning, which wasn't a big issue for us as we have a young baby who is up early anyway. <br/>Rosy's place is beautiful in every way, full of charm and character, and extremely functional as well- overall a great place to explore the best of San Francisco.<br/>",
8339,153952,2010-12-14,124136,Bianca,"My stay at the amazing Queen Victorian house, exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend! <br/><br/>Rosy & her husband were amazing hosts. <br/><br/>From the moment I walked into the flat I was stunned by its beauty, and elegance as well as surprised by how big the flat actually is! There is a fully stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes and utensils), a wonderful dinning room that looks as though it could fit a family of 6 very comfortably, a lovely entrance that would ""wow"" the queen herself, with the decadent wood floors, tall ceilings, and well planed out interior design. <br/><br/>The main room/master bedroom was fantastic. It supplied the solitude I had hoped for and was extremely comfortable and cleaner then most 4 star hotels. <br/><br/>The location is absolutely perfect. About 5 minutes away from dozens of shops, markets and fantastic restaurants. As well as 30 minutes walking away from the center of the city. If location is important, this place is the golden eye of the city, with life close within reach, in a wonderful safe neighborhood. ""Quite but close.""<br/><br/>Rosy her husband were amazingly responsive to my initial questions, and explained everything in perfect detail. Through out their vacation in europe they check up on how well I was doing, and made sure everything was well. They are wonderful people, very detail oriented as well as extremely accommodating. <br/><br/>I hope our paths cross again! <br/><br/>",
8339,213970,2011-03-31,419944,Matthew,"Wow. What an amazing house.  San Fran is cool, but this house is cooler thanks to Rosy's amazing taste and sense of style.<br/><br/>It's in a brilliant spot, centrally located so it's walking distance from almost everything worth seeing and doing. <br/><br/>This entire floor apartment is everything you see in the photos and more. The stunning marble kitchen and huge dining area are meticulously furnished with items form the Victorian era. But only if they're white of course.<br/><br/>The front bedroom is enormous, complete with an incredible bay window, comfortable bed with crisp, clean linen and a whole lounge area furnished with a relaxing designer sofa and occasional chairs.<br/><br/>And let's not forget Rosy. Make sure she's there to check you in because what she doesn't know about the restaurants, bars, clothing stores and markets in San Fran isn't with knowing. Plus she's just an awesome chick to meet and get to know and she makes a great espresso if you ask nicely ;-)<br/><br/>It's more than a place to stay while you experience San Fran, it's one of the highlights of your trip.",

The apartment was beautiful - a great experience to stay in such a beautifully renovated and decorated Victorian house in a nice and very convenient area in San Francisco. Walking distance to many areas such as Hayes, Mission, Castro and Haight. And going downtown was also easy. <br/><br/>Rosy was a great host! Very welcoming and offering many good suggestions for restaurants, fun neighbourhoods to visit etc. <br/><br/>The four of us that stayed at Rosy´s were really happy with our four day stay!<br/>",
8339,341342,2011-06-28,722750,Monica,"Rosy and her husband were gracious and lovely hosts.  The apartment was perfect in its location (great neighborhood), comfort, beauty and convenience.  Rosy's style is amazing but there is much more to their home than just the beautiful decor and amenities.  <br/><br/>Our family arrived late at night after a long day of travel and they took the time to give us a home tour, show us a stocked refrigerator with staples, including much needed coffee, and they happily answered countless questions about their home, the neighborhood and everything a visitor would want to know about the city.  <br/><br/>The beds were comfortable with plenty of blankets and the dining room was a favorite for the four of us to congregate, read, and share meals.  <br/><br/>Rosy even contacted me halfway through our visit to make sure all was going well.  <br/><br/>I would highly recommend staying here to anyone going to San Francisco and hope to return some day!

8339,598200,2011-10-04,837960,Deborah,"My best friend Amy and I stayed at Rosy’s for four glorious nights in late September/early October. It was our first Air bnb experience as well as our first time in San Fransisco, and we most certainly hit the jack pot with Rosy’s stunning home. If I could rate our experience in San Fransisco out of 10 I would give it an 11.<br/><br/>Not only was the apartment breathtakingly gorgeous, it was also spotlessly clean, extremely spacious and in a fabulous location; walking distance to some seriously amazing restaurants, café’s and shops. Amy and I are a little interior design obsessed, and we thought that Rosy’s place looked so lovely in the photos we had seen prior to our arrival. The photos do not do Rosy’s justice by any means. In the flesh, it is even more beautiful and the attention to detail is unbelievable. <br/><br/>Rosy is an absolute genius, and super cool to boot. She gave us a list of all her favourite local places to get coffee and food and every single place we tried was completely delicious. Amy and I both agreed that the French bakery ‘Tartine’, in the Mission district, is hands down the best food experience of our lives, and a must for everyone visiting San Fran.<br/><br/>I wish that we had been able to stay longer in San Francisco, so that we could spend more time hanging out with Rosy and exploring the City. We will just have to go back again!<br/><br/>Rosy, our sincere thanks for making our time at your home so memorable. We had the trip of a lifetime. You are our Sibella Court =)<br/>",

It combines the charm of a San Franciscan Victorian with a clean and eclectic decorative aesthetic. Getting in was easy. Rosy and her husband made what can often be awkward and transactional process a true pleasure. Before long we we're talking like old friends. When it comes down to it, I'd recommend her space without reservation. And as long as they'll have me I'll never stay anywhere else in San Fran.",

Rosy's place was the perfect solution.  She and her husband were very helpful -- not just in things like recommending restaurants but right down to very important things like telling us how to get around on the Muni.  The apartment itself was a wonderful mix of old and new, and, once we understood the Muni, we realized that the neighborhood was fantastically located -- close to things but still quiet and comfortable.  I'd highly recommend Rosy's place.  I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.  ",

10537,9882904,2014-01-16,10986589,Lawrence,"Teresa is the most amazing, welcoming and considerate host. She couldn't have done more to make me feel more welcome. Her home is just gorgeous, the bed I slept in probably the most comfortable, her early morning coffee was delicious (reminds me, must ask her for name of brew) and on top of all this, Teresa is a PBS addict who introduced me to the Brit TV sensation 'Downton Abbey' which isn't really my cup of tea but with Teresa for company, even this was enjoyable! Stay with Teresa for a real home from home experience and a great sneak peak into the local culture.  ",
10537,9908100,2014-01-18,2104539,Michael,Teresa is a sweetheart. So very kind and easy to connect with. The house was quaint with a lot of stairs. The room was very nice and a great bed with awesome views of the entire city. It was hard to find but Teresa gave great directions. There a balcony that has a 180* views of the bay and all of San Francisco. AMAZING!!!  There's a great walking trail right outside the door and spectacular views when you reach the top. I will be back.,

Teresa’s home is truly an oasis for weary travelers, with the soft, cozy and luxurious furnishings and decor you just don’t want to leave! This incredible lady knows how to make someone feel very special and it’s not something she has to try and achieve… It just comes naturally for her because of her big heart and genuine thoughtfulness.

We found Teresa’s listing after searching for hours for a reasonable hotel in the area. I’m SO glad we came across her because she responded to our inquiry for same day check in late in the afternoon. The thing that stood out the most was Teresa’s hospitality. She always went out her way for us and was very kind. We’ve never stayed in a shared space Airbnb before but Teresa really makes you comfortable in her home. We were welcomed with homemade chocolate chip cookies and water. During our stay she was always offering assistance and things for us to use that make our visit better. Her house is lovely and quite large, very clean and comfortable. I definitely recommend. Thanks again Teresa!",

You could walk down the hill to the Powell BART in about 12 minutes; uphill, a little longer! We stayed a week (and are going back for a much longer stint!) and Andrew was really fantastic and easy to deal with. He recommended a literary event down the street and I had great fun at it and met him and his friends so that was a nice extra. <br/>The apartment gets great light and is very clean. The kitchen is more than fine, plenty of room to do whatever you need to do. The bed was new and was very comfortable. And the leather arm chair was a godsend - I camped out there, doing some writing etc. The table by the window is perfect for meals. It was very easy dealing with Andrew and he was very fast in his communication back and forth. We had no issues at all. It couldn't have been more seamless. Highly recommend it!",

She loaned me her cell fone as mine wouldn’t operate in the USA and she had no landline.  I felt guilty for waking up on eastern time and using the shower.  But she didn’t mind and was often headed out to the gym or for a run before I got out.  Her place is just like the fotos.  The big screen TV was, well, big.  We did some breakfast and dinner cooking, and washed up after ourselves.<br/><br/>The bed was comfy.  Wear earplugs as the traffic from the street below can be noisy for light sleepers.  The only issue we had, which was entirely out of Rachel’s control was the 10 minute, garbage truck loading cycle, below the bedroom window.  This occurred at about 5:30 am on weekdays, 6:30 am on Sat and about 9 am on Sun.<br/><br/>Yes, we would stay again at the Nook!",

She works in the SF office so is close. The nook is a nice cozy place. Rachael has made a great guide for you that she sends to you before arrival, and had snacks waiting for me too! We were both pretty busy during my stay, so did not get to hang out much, but it was pleasant chatting when we did. Nob Hill is SF's upscale and tranquil neighborhood. A bit of a hike at times, but perfect for people trying to get in shape like me. Of course, there is always the cable car if you don't feel like the walk. The Cathedral is nearby, and my favorite Cafe Cento, which is attached to the Fairmont Hotel is a great place to plop down and get some work done. Overall, this was a good central place to stay.",

11490,5093453,2013-06-11,6727038,Jose,"My wife and I stayed at the Nook for 3 days and we had a great time. The bedroom itself is an okay size, but the living room are made it feel much more cozy. Rachael was traveling, so we had the whole apartment to ourselves, making it truly feel like a home away from home! Also, the area is surrounded by restaurants, shopping, and many other places of interest. We didn't get the apartment keys before we arrived, but Rachael went above and beyond to be sure we got a spare upon arrival. Thanks Rachael! Would definitely stay here again!",

She was very insightful and was really down to earth. The location was great, just a few minutes of a walk from public transport such as BART, and a few minutes away from Union Square and China town. The bedroom was a nice size, very clean. The entire apartment was very nice, I felt a lot more comfortable staying there once I saw how clean Rachael kept it. Thank you for the hospitality Rachel! I will be booking this same room the next time I travel to San Francisco. I would recommend this option to anyone!",

12041,543086,2011-09-18,994868,Steven,"Note: this review is for the Carl St. property. I'm not sure why this listing says Ashbury St, the pictures are for the Carl St. property. The Carl St. listing is also 20 to 30 dollars cheaper than this one per night.<br/><br/>Aaron was a good host. He explained things well. The building is in alright condition, just a little creaky. The room and bed were clean. The common areas were all fine. The other guests were pretty quiet and easy to get along with.  The surrounding area is nice (easy grocery shopping, muni stop right at the corner).<br/><br/>My only issue was the price. If the price was lower I would feel better about staying here and recommending it to others. As it is, I think it was too much money ($80 per night) for just an OK place to stay.",
12041,2545792,2012-10-08,3253572,Tobi,"Aaron was a great host for during my first week in San Francisco. I forgot to call him before I arrived but I met him before the house right when I arrived. He immediately showed me the room and part of the neighborhood.<br/><br/>The room itself was reasonably spacious. The furniture simple but effective. For example, the bed was built out of a stack of four mattresses. The other occupants of the house were generally very quiet, though I had a nice chat occasionally. The kitchen was usually clean; everyone in the house seemed to play by the rules (i.e., clean your own dishes). Bathrooms were ok as well. One time the knob to flush the toilet was broken, but Aaron fixed it within hours.<br/><br/>Overall: good, simple and effective housing :-)<br/><br/>Thanks Aaron!",
12041,18806259,2014-09-01,9817219,Kalev,"I was looking for a temporary place to stay in the city for the month of August, and the place that Aaron listed ended up being perfect for my needs. The room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable to live in. The house had shared bathrooms and kitchen, and was run like a hostel. Again, for temporary accommodations this was perfect, and the location on the edge of the Inner Sunset and Upper Haight was great. The N line runs right in front of the house, and it is convenient to get everywhere. Everything was well maintained in the house, and I noticed Aaron come by often to take care of things in the house. I would recommend this listing to anyone looking for temporary accommodations in the city.",
12041,36867590,2015-07-02,1555070,Aaron,"This place is run like a hostel although I never saw other guests. <br/><br/>It is very close to Golden Gate Park (a few blocks). There is a Walgreens a block away and tons of great restaurants. There is also a grocery store right across the street. The Muni (N) stops right in front of the house which is great.<br/><br/>That being said, the house needs remodeling. The internet was very slow at .05-.15 mb/s so it was often unusable. Everything felt/smelled moldy (especially the bathrooms).",

12042,18447138,2014-08-26,18903791,Eric,"Aaron is a really nice guy. If there is anything you want he's very alert!<br/>However there was mice feces in our bed (that Aaron cleaned up immediately after we told him about it). It wasn't the exact same room as shown on the picture, the one we got didn't have a real bed but four mattresses stacked up on each other.<br/>The towels we got were moldy and the whole building smells like mold so it doesn't feel like the healthiest of environments. There was no visible mold except for in the bathroom though.<br/>Overall quiet building with a good host but lower standards as you can expect when paying such a low price.",
12042,36612983,2015-06-29,35087011,Julio,Host definitely made me feel welcomed. The room is not exactly the one in the pictures but very similar. The outside traffic is kind of loud so if you're a light sleeper keep that in mind. The bathroom is shared by four other guests so also be aware of that but you do have a private sink in the room. ,
12042,41959134,2015-08-10,23947735,Bear Mommy,"Aaron is very nice and welcoming. The house is only several minutes walk to UCSF and is right next to Golden Gate Park. There's an N line station right outside which is super convenient. The kitchen is equipped with everything you'll need for a short-term or long-term stay. However everything in the room is quite old, it seemed to be clean though.",
12042,51195352,2015-10-18,45551282,Sachin,We had a comfortable stay in the house. The best part is that the muni stop just in front of the house which makes travel to anyplace very easy.

Aaron was very responsive and always responded to whatever doubts or problems I had. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone new to the city.

Just a block away in either direction is all you want in San Francisco and more, but the place is still in a really quiet street.

12522,62892,2010-07-09,3,Brian,"Staying with Brenda was an amazing experience. Her place is immaculately designed, with a very worldly feel to it. The house is situated in the heart of the Castro district, and is surrounded by excellent restaurants offering various cuisines from around the world. Brenda is a lifelong world traveler that is very open-minded, and interested in meeting new people. As a design enthusiast, her apartment is furnished with beautiful details. The bedroom is excellent for 1 person, though I don't think it would be comfortable for a couple. Also, if you are very tall (6'4""+), you will likely me too tall for the bed. Other than that, the place is fantastic. Would stay there again.",

I had the pleasure of being in SF for 6 days and it was totally convenient to get everywhere from the perfectly located Castro.

Her neighbourhood is only a few blocks from the 16th St BART station, safe, easy to walk around and, best of all, really has that SF feel to it. She lent me a set of City Walk cards which were great for exploring the Castro and surrounding neighbourhoods - from beautiful murals and incredible tacos in the Mission district to the village feel of Noe Valley. <br/>The room and flat were comfortable and clean, and her dog and cats were always friendly company.

She is very easy-going, smart, conversational and has great taste.  Her place is both comfortable and artsy.  I loved all the books and art work.  My bed was just right for one person, and I loved her cute pets.  She has a nice big kitchen where I sat at the table and ate fruit and cheese from the local organic market while gazing out the window and imagining what it would be like to live in the Castro.  By the way, you can eat, drink and shop on Castro street and stumble the very few steps home and fall into the comfortable bed.  No cabs and no sweat! When I go back to my favorite American city, I will stay with Brenda again!",

First off, the basics--perfectly located between the Castro and Mission and less than 5 minutes from public transportation; a beautiful, cozy, light filled space, tastefully decorated; and a very comfortable bed. But more importantly, the experience--Brenda is incredible, funny, witty, and very open minded. <br/><br/>Exceptionally hospitable, she anticipated all my needs...I was under the weather one day and she insisted on getting me something from the pharmacy. Another night, she had friends over to dinner and insisted I join. I felt like a SF native by the end of my trip! <br/><br/>Brenda's truly felt like a home away from home and I look forward to staying with her next time I'm in SF!",

It was a really great experience overall. I recommend it fully without any reservations.",
12522,174898,2011-01-25,352384,Joy,"Logistics first. The room/apartment was everything I was looking for: peaceful, bright, and well-located. It is quiet and serene, while remaining very close to transportation and restaurants/cafes. The bed was very comfortable, and I had everything that I needed (and even a couple of additional nice touches, including a sound-muffling device, hooks on the back of the door, and extra blankets.) <br/> <br/>Brenda was a lovely, lovely host. Really, there's nothing more that I could ask for. She was kind and super accommodating. She provided me with a list of recommended restaurants nearby, and was even thoughtful enough to leave a set of cards detailing the best walks in San Francisco in the bedroom. She invited me to join the conversation when she had a couple of friends over. <br/><br/>Most of all, I truly felt welcome at her apartment, and actually looked forward to returning to it at night. This was very important, especially since I was traveling alone in a new place. Thank you for such a wonderful experience, Brenda, and I'll definitely call when I'm next in town!   <br/><br/> ",

12522,188581,2011-02-26,42196,Josefin,"Staying with Brenda is the ultimate San Francisco experience! I stayed with Brenda last year, this year, and will stay here everytime I visit SF. Brenda is kind, funny, and goes out of her way to help you out and make you feel at home, as well as finding the best places to go! The location is perfect, on a quiet street round the corner from the Castro, and a few blocks from the resturants and bars at Valencia and 16th. <br/>I'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great time in San Francisco!",
12522,191074,2011-03-01,409192,Christopher,"Honestly, I can really say I was NERVOUS at first. But when I first met Brenda and boo(my new bff) the transition from stranger out of the cab into house-guest was quite seamless. Her house is clean and you wouldn't even be able to tell she had 2 cats if you didn't see them or their litter box(which is also clean and strategically placed)!<br/><br/>Brenda made me feel like we had always been friends and that I was just staying over for the weekend, perfect host and FULL of energy and life. Gave me maps and listings to explore the city, and made me feel comfortable enough to venture all about. I'm definitely coming back to San Francisco and staying at Brenda's because this was one of the nicest EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE.",

A comfy bed in a charming flat, close to a lot of public transports (even an historical cable-car) and moreover with a so nice, helpful and well-organised host. Brenda was always ready to give me a hand and she definitely made my first days in SF easier (included an invitation to an opening with her so lively and funny friend). If you have never seen someone who can swim across sf bay from Alcatraz (alive, I mean), you have to go to Brenda's. She has done it twice !!!! With all my respect and thanks.",

Her place is easy to get to via transit and is in an interesting area of the city with great restaurants only a short walk away.<br/><br/>The room offered a quiet place to sleep as well as a desk to work which was a bonus. I also managed to unwind in the evening with her comfortable living room or beautiful kitchen.<br/><br/>Brenda's pets were very easy to get along with and well behaved as well.",

She was so accommodating and welcoming and her place is amazing, exactly where you want to stay in San Francisco! It is so close to both the F tram and the Muni stations, Market street is less than 2 blocks away and there is a Safeway, Walgreens, great Japanese and a fabulous bookstore all within a 5 minute walk. <br/>The cats are gorgeous and if you're a cat person, you will enjoy their company! I had a great time getting to know Brenda, I had been working non-stop for the previous 10 days before going to SF for a break and it was the perfect place to relax and chill out, can't wait to come back here again someday :)",

Every little detail was taken care of, from wifi, to maps to where to buy the best coffee! In the short time I spent in the apartment (and as others have mentioned in previous reviews), it felt as if I'd know Brenda for years. She has a lovely friendly and warm nature, is easy to talk to and is very accommodating. The lovely Boo dog, and the two cats were a lovely added bonus to my stay. Thank you, Brenda!",
12522,256083,2011-05-09,203305,Calvin,"I stayed with Brenda once a month for about 6 months in a row in San Francisco and could not have had a better experience.<br/>Her warm character and inclusiveness made me feel at home in her flat.  We shared several meals, glasses of wine, and <br/>great conversation and I consider her a friend.  Anyone traveling to San Francisco seeking a good location, safe surroundings, <br/>and a knowledgeable host would be lucky to stay at Perfectly Located Castro.  Thanks so much Brenda!",

She is thoughtful, warm, kind, and very easy going.  I really appreciate her restaurant tips and as a result, I had some great food : )  Her apartment is beautiful and artistic, which reflects her taste.  Her two kitties are adorable and Boo is very friendly.  The location is unbeatable - a quiet neighborhood in the heart of Castro.  <br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoyed staying with Brenda and I will definitely go back when I visit San Francisco again.

The location is awesome, being 3 MUNI stops to Powell (Union Square); the house is very well-decorated; the bedroom is cozy and the bed is super comfortable! Towels were provided and the entire place was nice and clean. Her pets were nice to have around too. Overall, you get a comfy, homey place to stay but you have privacy when you want it. My best Airbnb experience to date!",

12522,292960,2011-06-01,526419,Gretchen,"Brenda's place was the perfect spot for a solo traveler like me. She was out of town for my first two nights there, but mailed me the key well in advance of my stay. I was so exhausted from a half day of travel my first night there, and nothing looked cozier than that little red room once I finally made it to SF! Additionally, the apartment is in a great location. I walked all over the Mission and Castro with no problem, and for a slightly longer stroll headed up to Haight one morning. Lots of public transit options nearby. Brenda herself is a lovely host, and made me feel completely at home. And the dog and cat are so sweet!",
12522,311859,2011-06-13,614080,Janis,"I really enjoyed my stay at Brenda's.  The room was small, but clean and charming.  The apartment was lovely and Brenda was helpful and informative.  I would stay there again and the location really is perfect.",
12522,316457,2011-06-15,476785,Misato,"I was looking for a spot in a nice neighbourhood (with good coffee& wifi joints around, but also good connections for venturing out to explore SF) as a base for my 3 day stay there.. and Perfectly Located Castro was, well... perfect! Brenda was lovely, extremely helpful and friendly. I really appreciated her hospitaliy and personal recommendations of places around the neighbourhood, which offers so much in terms of eateries and cool shops. The flat is beautiful, and the room, very comfortable. It has great character, very cosy and clean. Location wise, it's a nice (and I felt very safe) walk down to the very cool Mission Dolores and Valencia street. Public transport links are also very good for venturing afar. In sum, I had a really fun stay - thanks Brenda! PS. For anyone who tays here in the future, I would definitely recommend starting your visit with a climb up corona hill, which is just a short walk away and give you a perfect panorama of the city.",

The bedroom is adorable and cozy, and I felt immediately at home. The place itself is also a gem... the kitchen in the morning is such a lovely spot! The neighbourhood is perfect... close to so many adorable little restaurants and cafes (Cafe Sophie became my home away from home), funky neighbourhoods (Castro, Mission), and super close to the Muni, busses and not too far from the BART.<br/><br/>I spent three weeks with Brenda and I could not have chosen a better host to have my first Airb'nb experience with! A couple of notes: I am allergic to cats, but Brenda's place is so clean and airy that I never once had a reaction. I also fell in love with Mumu, the world's sweetest cat, and Boo, the sprightly little rescue pup. Finally, I was there to work (which wasn't always easy in such a fun neighbourhood and city) and my desk space and WIFI made my room at Brenda's into the perfect little office. I would encourage you to book with Brenda without hesitation, she'll help make your SF experience the best it can be!",

When I arrived in San Francisco, she answered all my questions about public transportation, what to see and much more. She also gave me some great tips. She told me to rent a bike and ride to the Golden Gate Bridge. That was probably the highlight of my 3 days in SF. Oh and one night, we shared some trips memories. That was cool. Brenda traveled all around the world! Finally, at the end of my sejour at her place, she drove me to the rental car company (I then drove down to LA). That was very nice of her.<br/><br/>As for the house, it was very San Francisco-ish and very well located. Which is great because I felt like I really lived in the city for 2 or 3 days. It is a very beautiful and sunny house. It is only a couple of blocks away from the subway and bus (MUNI). The room is small but perfect for a single traveler. Again, a huge window so a lot of sun.

I also haven't been able to try all of the recommended places in her neighborhood, yet, but the ones I have tried were good. I also took advantage of the wash and fold service at the end of the block, which is super convenient. I'd highly recommend it.<br/>It was a little louder outside than the last time I stayed, but the white noise machine helped significantly.",

Brenda made me feel right at home and even provided a list of things to do nearby.  It truly is conveniently located.  I walked to several different restaurants nearby and public transportation was just around the corner.  You can stop by the Bi-Rite Creamery for freshly made ice cream and then find a spot on the hill of the Dolores Park to enjoy.  I would definitely stay with Brenda and her sweet dog and kitty again on my next visit to the city. ,

Her beautiful, lovingly decorated home is the ideal trailhead for exploring some of the most gorgeous neighborhoods of San Francisco - be it on foot or using any of the amply available means of public transport. I loved sleeping and working in the fiery red bedroom that always felt comfortable and cosy, but stimulating and inspiring at the same time. A home away from home - also because of her headstrong, yet very sweet cat and dog. Most of all I enjoyed meeting Brenda herself and spending time with her and her lovely housemate Gates - the perfect gentleman - discussing a range of topics as broad as the Amazonas river. Both are among the kindest and most generous people I have met on my travels. If you are looking for the real AirBnB experience - not just finding affordable lodging, but meeting inspiring people as well - this is the place for you.",

For the last three, I've had the pleasure of being a guest in local residences, each year affording me a wonderful opportunity to explore SF from beautiful locations.  This year was no exception staying with Brenda.  Her beautiful home was very comfortable, her animals loving, and a drawer she set aside for me in the refrigerator was extremely thoughtful!  Her neighborhood is a wonderful spring board to other SF locales, many of which are within walking distance from her home.

Brenda has had an interesting career in publishing and has worked with some of my favorite photographers. So it was a definite bonus to sit and share some of those experiences with her. Art, music, food, and of course pets...good company, good conversation. MuMu is the sweetest kittie and Boo, although we disagreed on some issues, is nobody's fool and fiercely devoted to Brenda. My room was comfy and quiet (even though it faces the street) with good desk space and wifi. Location, location, location...perfect is definitely the word. My favorite restaurant and bakery withing a few blocks (no, not the famous ones which are also close by). Two 'new favorites' suggested by Brenda. If needed, there is a cleaners and laundromat on the block, a bike shop around the corner, a library around the other corner and a Radio Shack two blocks up on Market St.  I am hoping to return this Spring and would definitely stay here again.

12522,4857590,2013-05-29,5087406,Justin,"Brenda was a wonderful hostess for a first time AirBNBer.  The apartment was exactly as she described it, no rude surprises, and the directions from the airport were extremely helpful. She was very accomodating with my arrival time, especially with a flight delay that caused me to arrive late into the evening.  The space is the perfect size for a traveler that intends on spending the majority of their time exploring the city.  I found her list of local neighborhood eateries VERY helpful and overall an easy person to talk to.  Thanks for an excellent first impression!  ",
12522,4923327,2013-06-02,1487229,Ana,"I had a great stay with Brenda, her flatmate and her pets :) She's a genial and sweet host and we always had nice conversations. Her house is really perfectly located between Castro and the Mission, you can reach any place in the city easily! The house and the room are finely decorated. I felt at home and would have loved to stay longer there! Thanks Brenda!!",

The location is truly fantastic, the home is full of warmth and culture and the pets are super welcoming too. I don't think I've ever received so much affection from a cat before! On top of all that Brenda was easy to contact in advance and was flexible with my ambiguous arrival arrangements! Thank you Brenda!",
12522,5100566,2013-06-12,912977,Sebastian,"Brenda is a great host! She was super welcoming and flexible. I stayed there for 6 nights and I just loved it. The neighborhood is great with walking distance to the Castro and Mission/Valencia Street.<br/><br/>The apartment is exactly as described. I just loved it! The room is small but for one person totally enough. <br/><br/>The best thing about the apartment is Ike's Place, just 100m away. I 've been there a couple of times as the sandwiches are just awesome! <br/><br/>I will definitely recommend Brenda's apartment to everybody. I will stay there again when back in San Francisco.<br/>",

Brenda's place certainly is 'Perfectly Located' with everything I needed within easy travelling distance.<br/><br/>Brenda herself was very welcoming and made me feel more like a friend than a paying guest. She leads a busy lifestyle, but was always there when I had any questions, and recommended many fantastic restaurants and places to visit.<br/><br/>As for the room, it is a perfect size for a solo traveler - the bed has a very comfortable mattress, which was perfect after a long flight, and the desk in the room is a good size, with enough space to work if you need it.<br/><br/>The rest of the apartment is nicely decorated, with a light and airy feel throughout.<br/><br/>I also had the opportunity to meet some of Brenda's friends and family and had some very interesting conversations with the group - thanks for that Brenda!<br/><br/>",

12522,7004632,2013-09-03,5200120,Ruth,"Brenda was a fantastic host. Communication was easy and clear from the start. Her apartment is beautiful and centrally located so using public transport is simple. There are lots of great places to eat and shop nearby and Brenda provided recommendations, information, flyers and directions as required. Her apartment is a great base from which to explore San Francisco and a comfortable, clean and welcoming environment to come back to at the end of the day. Good conversation and two cute pets (a cat and a dog) help make this place feel like home from home. ",

Thank you so much, Brenda for your hospitality!!! ",
12522,7268503,2013-09-13,6425357,Tamera,"The small room in Brenda's home was perfect for my needs. It is a well lit room with a big desk and a fast Wi-Fi. The twin size bed is fine for a single person and she has made great use out of the small space. I love books, and she surrounds you with all sorts of reading/browsing material.<br/>I have stayed at a few air-b-n-b's in San Francisco and this is my fav so far. Parking is not an issue and the are lots of options for dining out or grocery shopping. <br/>Three people share the bathroom, but that was not an issue since we had different schedules. her cat is sweet and her cute dog barks only when you enter and then disappears! (where did that little doggie go during the day?!)<br/>I will stay here again. thanks, Brenda.",

I really appreciate the thoughtful gesture of preparing a map and a San Francisco guide, plus a list of good eateries on the table.  Her apartment is simply gorgeous and I love how my room is decorated.  Everything about my stay had been perfect.  Her apartment is just a few blocks away from convenient transport system (tram + Muni underground stations + BART) to the downtown area or airport.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.  Thank you very much, Brenda.",

From the time I arrived, Brenda was easy to contact and she offered many useful tips for visiting the city, as well as a map and a list of ideas on what to do. The room isn't huge, but it's a nice, cozy bedroom with a twin bed, all that I needed for my stay. Also, a great desk for plugging in and working from my laptop when I needed to do so. Everything was as described and Brenda was a great host. I would definitely recommend staying here to others if you're looking for a one-person private bedroom. (Thanks, Brenda!)",

She gave my many informations about the city and ideas what to do during my stay. She tried really hard, for a unforgettable stay in SanFrancisco. The guest room is small, but arranged with love. Castro is a nice and safe neighborhood and close to the tourist-hotspots. I can absolutely recommend Brenda. Thank you for the great time!",
12522,8248802,2013-10-22,7168360,Robert,"The accomodations: tidy and quaint, street-side room was quiet and comfortable.  Amenities were appropriate for the price; high-speed wi-fi was available, although I barely used it.  Shared bathroom was clean and accessible.  Perfectly well-behaved pets were warm and friendly.<br/><br/>The location: a stone's throw away from A Kitchen Story, featured on the United States of Bacon -- Millionaire's Bacon and bottomless mimosas.  Not too far from local hangout, Tartine (line is usually long, but moves quickly, and paninis are ginormous).  Walking distance to Union Square, although you have to go through a seedy area to do it.  Stay on Market and you'll be fine.  I was able to run through Haight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park very easily, as well as a run to the top of Lombard Street.  And, obviously, it is very close to the Castro if that is your intended destination.<br/><br/>The hostess: Very nice and accommodating.  Left work early to let me in, after I missed my flight and arrived later than expected.  Spent the time to talk with me, without ever getting up in my business.  If I needed something, she was there.  If I didn't, she wasn't.  Further, when I found I needed another day, it was no problem.<br/><br/>The price: How can you beat the price for the location?  Perfect for what I needed, which was basically a bed and a shower.<br/><br/>The Final Word: The place was perfect for my needs.  Unassuming and quaint, I felt at home, as if I was visiting a relative.  Close to everything that I wanted to be close to, yet away from the hustle and bustle.",

Brenda herself is an awesome, open and fun host. She provided me with maps and more on San Francisco - I highly recommend her apartment to anyone looking to have a fun time in San Francisco!",
12522,8480340,2013-11-02,5547707,Karen,"I was in town for business and decided that I'd rather stay near my old apartment in the Mission rather than a boring hotel. Brenda's place was perfect: a couple short blocks to a major Muni stop and Castro St, and just a tiny bit more to the Mission.<br/><br/>If you have trouble with stairs, this isn't the place for you (nor are most places in SF), as the apartment is on the second floor. The room is in the front of the apartment, overlooking the street, with a twin bed and a desk. Street noise is minimal, but if you're sensitive to it, bring earplugs. Even on Halloween it was very quiet though! If you're new to the city, Brenda thoughtfully provided a couple tour books and a sheet of reviews for nearby restaurants and cafes. There were other nice touches, like super soft towels and an extra blanket for those cold SF nights. I felt very welcomed and at home there, especially with her adorable little dog and cat.<br/><br/>Runners, if you want a challenge, jog down to Dolores Park and do loops around it. The park is on a steep hill, which will give you a great workout but the way there and back is flat for a nice warmup/cooldown.<br/><br/>My company sends me back every 3 months to SF; I will definitely be staying with Brenda again!",

Once I checked in she introduced me to the house and the pets and we got stuck talking for a good hour. She's a welcoming, open minded, warm and embracing host- I just enjoyed staying at her place so much. Her tips for anything - no matter if it was hiking or dining- just got me into the right place at the right time! If I wasn't staying with her, I would have missed full San Francisco satisfaction. <br/>There's not much left to say- the place is lovely, clean, cozy and with Brenda as a host just like a second home.

When some other guest cancelled shortly before the proposed arrival, Brenda called me and offered me stay with her again as she knew I was looking for a place to stay at for extra time. I think it was outrageously nice from her to remember me and ask me for an additional stay instead of just open up the period to everybody.<br/>The week was simply awesome like the few days I stayed with her before: the place is beautiful, clean and welcoming (not to talk about its perfect location) and Brenda the best host you can imagine. I felt home in San Francisco, among friends and in a known environment although the city and Brenda were completely new to me from the beginning. Besides all the smart tips she gave me to enjoy the city, I simply loved our conversations in company of a good wine. She even invited me to an arts opening and some tasty dinner!<br/>All in all San Francisco will never be the same for me without staying at Brenda's place in her and her sweet pets (just cute!!) company.

The room is small but fine for 1 person, and when you're in SF, you're not gonna spend much time in your room anyway.<br/>The neighbourhood is excellent, good location but not too busy/not a lot of noise. <br/>I would definitely stay here again!",
12522,20275993,2014-09-27,16133120,Elizabeth,"Perfectly located Castro was a dream! Listing was exactly as described and then some. Brenda made me feel very welcome while respecting my privacy. Between her restaurants recommendations and 50 Walks in San Francisco, I felt less like a traveler and more like a citizen of this irresistible city.<br/><br/>Castro is a wonderful neighborhood to stay in with cool shops, restaurants, etc and very easy transport to downtown. I also enjoyed morning walks in the close by Buena Vista park - another gem not to miss.<br/><br/>Without hesitation I recommend Perfectly located Castro and hostess Brenda to anyone looking for an authentic San Francisco experience.<br/><br/>",

It was my first BNB stay and i had a fantastic experience. It is obvious that Brenda has hosted a lot of guests and her hospitality was fantastic. <br/><br/>She was genuinely welcoming, and even though i was only there for a few days i felt right at home. She also provided me with a variety of local maps, with some great suggestions for local eating. If travelling alone, i would definitely stay with Brenda again. ",

Very short walking distance to MUNI. Brenda was a very nice and welcoming host. Would definitely stay there again.",
12522,23203238,2014-11-25,9550107,Cindy,"I had a wonderful stay at Perfectly located Castro. Brenda is the most wonderful host - great conversation, incredibly kind-hearted, and plenty of information about the area and San Francisco is provided. Her apartment is incredibly beautiful and the location is fantastic. MUNI and BART stops are just a few blocks away, as are quaint cafes, lovely parks, and grocery stores. The Painted Ladies is a short walk away, and Twin Peaks are fairly close to. Downtown is just a short MUNI ride away. The room is snug and cosy and very comfortable and clean. Her pets Boo and Mumu are the sweetest too. I highly recommend staying at Perfectly located Castro, and I look forward to staying there again next time I visit San Fran. The apartment feels just like home!<br/><br/>Thank you very much for a wonderful stay, Brenda! You are a wonderful ambassador for Airbnb, and I hope to stay with you again next time I come to San Fran.",
12522,23264609,2014-11-27,11008628,Greg,"Thanks for Brenda for letting me stay. I came to San Fran during Thanks Giving like Christmas it's fun but busy period. Brenda took time out to make me feel comfortable. I arrived really late and Brenda waited up  to greet me. Her place is clean and charming. The room she offers is nicely decked out. There is so much close by in Castro, let only why you have visited San Fran. Brenda is such a buddle of knowledge so don't be afraid to ask. I was at the end of my 4 weeks holiday, heading back to Australia. So once again Thanks Brenda for letting me stay.",

12522,23596127,2014-12-06,22251794,Hemlata,"This was my very first airbnb experience. And I was expecting the worst to begin with.  The first night indeed didn't turn out so good as I was very cold and could not sleep because of it. But the next day when the hostess asked how my night was and I told her I felt a bit cold, she made sure the heat was turned up the next night and I slept quite well. The room itself is quite small, painted orange, a library converted to bedroom with books and a huge ladder. The experience of being surrounded by so many books was quite good actually. Although the bed was smaller than I would have liked. The hostess is friendly, unintrusive and reasonably helpful.  And she actually took efforts to get my name pronunciation right. My body was 4 hours ahead of SFO coming from Canadian Atlantic which helped me follow the rule of not using the bathroom between 6:30-7:15.  Overall a good stay, though I initially didnt know how to take this intermediate between a hotel and house stay with the constant awkwardness of being in a strangers home and with me turning the key the wrong way the first day with my passport, laptop and documents in the house giving myself and am sure Brenda a mini heart attack. She was gracious consoling and comforting about this too. <br/>The most interesting though is the cat, it never sleeps. And sure wants to be rubbed constantly meowing and rubbing its body around u when u walk by.  The dog is adorable though not amenable to patting.<br/>Location is perfect. The Bart station is very close by. She has a lot of maps laid out and guide books to help one travel through the city.",
12522,23860138,2014-12-13,12227954,Meher,The room is very cosy and she has a very warm personality which makes you feel more of a friend than a guest.

12522,25436704,2015-01-16,10757238,Michele,"My second stay at Brenda's was exceptional!! I struggle to find appropriate adjectives to describe the hospitality that I got from Brenda. She provided me with lots of useful info about San Fran,  few good spots that I would never discovered on my own during my short stay; the house is incredibly well kept, the room is cosy, charming and it has a lovely view on one of the most picturesque streets in the Castro.  Local amenities, restaurants, bars are just few minutes walk from the house. It is really the ideal place to be if you visit San Fran for the first time and I would definitely recommend to everybody. I will be back to the States next year and I already know where I am going to stay.",

She is super friendly and I love her animals, Boo and MuMu the cat!  Staying in the Castro was close to everything and a very interesting and colorful way to experience San Francisco!  She left me a card and a delicious chocolate bar as a farewell gift. I would totally recommend her as a host!",

She has the entire process covered from every angle in a very clear and informative manner. I immediately felt comfortable and welcome in her space. She is genuinely warm, curious and naturally personable, without being falsely familiar.<br/><br/>Her responses in our communications were always timely. The space is beautiful, exactly as advertised, and there were no surprises. The apartment's location is fabulous for walking to many neighborhoods, and the MUNI and BART are quite near for more distant explorations. Brenda also offered up maps and personal recommendations for favorite bars, restaurants, bakeries, etc. in the  neighborhood, which were much appreciated. I could have even left my umbrella at home, as she has that covered, too.<br/><br/>Her dog and cat are delightful and made the stay even homier.

The house is only a few blocks from a great shopping area (Valencia st) and only a few min walk to the colourful Castro area. It's also easily accessed from the airport (the BART station is only a few blocks away). The house itself is beautiful and stylish and was impeccably clean. Both animals were friendly and Brenda was a courteous host who went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. The room, though small, was clean and stylishly decorated. The only issue was that there was noise from the street, but it was an easy fix with ear plugs and Brenda even supplied a fantastic sound cancelling machine!<br/>All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Sanchez and I don't think you could find anywhere nicer to stay for such a great price and such a great location!<br/>( I recommend Duboce Park Cafe for breakfast nearby!)<br/>Thank you!",

Brenda's lovely home is exactly as described and really cosy. The cat is the friendliest cat I have met so far and likes a little pat. Brenda is a lovely host.

She has the cutest pets with a dog that has the shortest attention span, and her roommate Serena was so sweet, and quiet, sometimes you wouldn't even know she was there. The room was a tight fit as she has mentioned to me in the beginning, but it's actually really cozy and I never went without a good nights sleep in there. It's a real cool looking room I might add, just don't try to climb the bamboo ladder.",
